          <h3>Playsets</h3>

          <h4>Adding a playset</h4>
          <p>If you have a <cite>Fiasco</cite> playset PDF, you can use it in Fiascomputer! To add a playset, press the <a href="/add-playset">Add Playset</a> button in either the menu or the <a href="/playsets">playset listing</a>.</p>
          <p>Hint: You can add more than one playset at a time.</p>
          <p><em>Note: Not all playset PDFs are guaranteed to work in Fiascomputer. For best results, use one of the playsets distributed by the publishers of <cite>Fiasco</cite>, <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/" target="_blank">Bully Pulpit Games</a>. Many other playsets can be found at <a href="http://fiascoplaysets.com/" target="_blank">FiascoPlaysets.com</a>.</em></p>

          <h4>Editing a playset</h4>
          <p>If you want to add your own touch to a playset, or if the playset was not correctly imported by Fiascomputer, you can edit it. To do so, open the <a href="/setup">setup page</a> and click any category or element to select it. In the table that appears, hover over the item that you want to edit and click the pencil that appears. You can also a playset's title in this way.</p>

          <h4>Creating a playset</h4>
          <p>Fiascomputer does not currently offer a way of creating entirely new playsets. That being said, you can still add an existing playset and then edit the items in it (as described above) to get something almost as good. (Just be sure not to save your only copy of a playset in Fiascomputer, as mentioned below.)</p>

          <h4>Deleting a playset</h4>
          <p>To delete a playset, select the playset in the <a href="/playsets">playset listing</a> and then press the Delete Playset button. You will return to the playset listing and the playset will be grayed out to show that it will be deleted. If you select the playset again, you can recover the playset. If you don't, the playset is permanently deleted when you close Fiascomputer.</p>

          <h4>Where are playsets stored?</h4>
          <p>After you have added a playset, it is stored inside your browser, which means that it won't be available on other computers or in other browsers on the same computer.

          <p><em>Note: Fiascomputer does not currently support saving playsets as files or otherwise exporting them from the app. For that reason, do not use Fiascomputer to store your only copy of a playset.</em></p>

          <h3>Setup</h3>

          <h4>Selecting items</h4>
          <p>To select the category or element for a relationship, press the text of that category or element. The same goes for details, but you first have to select whether that detail should be a Need, a Location, or an Object.</p>

          <h4>Deleting items</h4>
          <p>To delete a detail, category, or element, hover over it and press the cross that appears. To remove a relationship from the game altogether, select a different number of players in the available dropdown menu.</p>

          <h4>Random setups</h4>
          <p>To randomize an entire setup, press the Random button. To randomize a single category or element, click the die next to it.</p>

          <h4>Changing a player's name</h4>
          <p>To change the name of a player, hover over the player's name and press the pencil that appears.</p>

          <h4>Online play</h4>
          <p>To play with other players online through Google Drive, select "Invite players" in the menu.</p>

          <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

          <h4>Fullscreen</h4>

          <h4>Color themes</h4>
          <p>If you're feeling blue or otherwise think that Fiasco's red color theme doesn't suit your setup, try one of the other color themes available in the menu!</p>
